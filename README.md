# triviaAPI

For this project, part of my training at BeCode, we had to work with an API. I choose the trivia API, which is pretty cool, and the questions are quite difficult !
You can choose the questions category, the number of questions, the difficulty and then the type of quizz (multiple choices or true/false).
